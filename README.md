Bosun is a runtime environment for [BESM](http://gmao.ccst.inpe.br/besm/) and associated models. It is 
used to document and automate the tasks related to running a climate model (prepare inputs, compile 
the code, run the model, archive the results). It is based on Fabric and can be used as a library or CLI.
