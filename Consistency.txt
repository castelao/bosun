It is necessary to check the consistency of the run. Probably inside the tasks.py

I'll list here to keep track what is necessary

- start date

    date at INPUT/coupler.res need to agree with input.nml

      * Luiz: Kind of. If we don't put a current_date at input.nml the model
        uses the date at coupler.res. One check less to make, and we avoid
        duplicated information.

- diag table

    When tot_sum period is not coherent with the restart block period (smaller
    or bigger), how it is generated? Throw a warning? 

- input.nml

    - Need to set one of them to true: eos_linear, eos_preteos10, eos_teso10.

    barotropic_time_stepping_A = F & barotropic_time_stepping_B = T when using Open Boundary Conditions
